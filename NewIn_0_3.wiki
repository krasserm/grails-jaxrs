=Upgrade notes=

The default URL mapping changed in version 0.3. In version 0.2 all URLs were mapped to the {{{JaxrsController}}}. In version 0.3 the default URL mapping changed to 

  * {{{"/api"    (controller:"jaxrs")}}}
  * {{{"/api/**" (controller:"jaxrs")}}}

Refer to the [AdvancedFeatures#URL_mappings URL mappings] section for instructions how to change the default URL mapping. 

The auto-detection criteria for 

  * JAX-RS resource classes under {{{grails-app/resources}}} and
  * JAX-RS provider classes under {{{grails-app/provider}}}

are now better aligned with the JAX-RS specification 1.0, sections 3.1 and 4.2.
