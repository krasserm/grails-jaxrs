    * Allow usage of Grails [AdvancedFeatures#Domain_objects domain classes] in resource method signatures
    * Support for [AdvancedFeatures#Domain_objects content negotiation] using the {{{Accept}}} request header
    * Can be disabled by means of [AdvancedFeatures#Configuration configuration]
  * [AdvancedFeatures#Custom_providers Custom entity provider] support
    * Base classes for custom domain object providers
      * {{{org.grails.jaxrs.support.DomainObjectReaderSupport}}}
      * {{{org.grails.jaxrs.support.DomainObjectWriterSupport}}}
    * Base classes for more general entity providers (improved)
      * {{{org.grails.jaxrs.support.MessageBodyReaderSupport}}}
      * {{{org.grails.jaxrs.support.MessageBodyWriterSupport}}}
  * [GettingStarted#Scaffolding Scaffolding enhancements]
    * XML and JSON representations
    * Content negotiation support
  * Auto-detection of JAX-RS resource classes better aligned with the JAX-RS specification (incl. support for annotation inheritance)
  * Auto-detection of JAX-RS provider classes better aligned with the JAX-RS specification
  * Default URL mapping for {{{JaxrsController}}} [#Upgrade_notes changed]
  * Upgrade to Grails 1.1.2
  * Upgrade to Jersey 1.1.4.1
  * Upgrade to Restlet 2.0-M6

==Known issues==

  * There's a bug ([http://restlet.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=971 issue 971]) in Restlet 2.0-M6 that forces implementors of {{{MessageBodyReader}}} and {{{MessageBodyWriter}}} to *directly* implement these interfaces. Extending a class that implements these interfaces doesn't work. Restlet will ignore the provider in this case. 

==Upgrade notes==

The default URL mapping changed in version 0.3. In version 0.2 all URLs were mapped to the {{{JaxrsController}}}. In version 0.3 the default URL mapping changed to 

  * {{{"/api"    (controller:"jaxrs")}}}
  * {{{"/api/**" (controller:"jaxrs")}}}

Refer to the [AdvancedFeatures#URL_mappings URL mappings] section for instructions how to change the default URL mapping. 

The auto-detection criteria for 

  * JAX-RS resource classes under {{{grails-app/resources}}} and
  * JAX-RS provider classes under {{{grails-app/provider}}}

are now better aligned with the JAX-RS specification 1.0, sections 3.1 and 4.2.
